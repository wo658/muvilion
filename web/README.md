# muvilion — drawing studio

The home page is a drawing-first workspace: upload PDF, PNG/JPEG or optional DXF, crop a space, review evidence, calibrate a known distance, edit walls, place objects and inspect 3D. Muse chat uses the Vercel AI SDK; interpretation and layout proposals require explicit Apply.

## Run

```sh
# engine/
uv sync
uv run uvicorn app.main:app --reload
# web/
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Set `ENGINE_URL` (default http://localhost:8000) and `MODEL_API_KEY` in gitignored `web/.env.local`. Existing model provider configuration is reused. Extraction/manual editing work without a model key. The studio needs the actual Python engine, not ENGINE_MOCK.

## Pipeline

- PDF: pdfplumber vectors/text + PDFium preview; OpenCV supplements raster content.
- Images: Pillow orientation + OpenCV line candidates. Raster OCR is not implemented.
- DXF: ezdxf ASCII modelspace entities; optional, no PDF-to-DXF conversion. Binary DXF and CAD layer/dimension relationships are not supported.
- `lib/plans/schema.ts`: normalized evidence, confirmed scale and editable objects.
- Muse interprets fixed line IDs and proposes booth/stage/lounge objects; geometry checks report overlap, wall intersections and bounds.
- SVG review + React Three Fiber preview; JSON import/export and browser local storage.

All extracted lines start unknown. Scale requires confirmation. 3D uses schematic wall thickness/height; this is a concept editor, not construction-grade reconstruction or an evacuation validator. Legacy simulation modules remain in the repository but are not the studio workflow.

## Local real drawings

Place local PDFs under root `DemoData/` or set `DEMO_DATA_DIR`:

- `san-jose-mcenery-floor-plan-and-specs.pdf`: Facebook F8 venue brochure; useful context, not detailed architectural geometry.
- `coex-hall-a-2024.pdf`: official COEX Hall A dimensioned plan, available from [COEX floor plans](https://business.coex.co.kr/exhibition-hall/coex-lease-info/floor-plan/).

PDFs are local evaluation assets, not bundled or committed. Source metadata lives alongside them. The UI reports missing files rather than supplying a synthetic substitute.

## Checks

```sh
pnpm test
pnpm typecheck
pnpm lint
pnpm build
```

Engine checks: `uv run pytest`, `uv run ruff check .`. Regenerate engine OpenAPI types with `pnpm gen:engine-types` after contract changes.
